## What libraries do we need to load? 

## Source in your hidden api-keys.R file

##  Let's construct the API call.
# base_uri <-

# resource <-

# query_params <- list(
  # what (optional) parameters do we need?
# )

# response <-

# response_content <-

# parsed_data <-

## Yay! Now we should have our data. Let's View(parsed_data) to see what we have to work with.

## Let's try out some fun data wrangling questions!
# Concatenate the full address of what you passed into the API call (as if we were writing it to mail a letter)

# Here's a challenge... can you find the ratio of officials in the Democratic Party to officials in the Republican Party?

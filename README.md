# API_lab

In lab today, we will get the data you will be using for Assignment 6 and ask some interesting questions about it.
For your reference, here is the [Google Civic API documentation](https://developers.google.com/civic-information/docs/v2/)

But let's first explore what resources this API gives us access to and what information we must provide to get access. Spend some time clicking through the tabs on the left-hand side of the page.

Now, to query from the Google Civic API, we must first construct the HTTP request with the parameters we want. 
Well, what are we looking for?

Assignment 6 says 
> Your final product should contain the code along the following lines:
the main part of it should be a function (e.g. 'repTable') that **takes
address as the argument**, and returns a markdown table of **representatives**.

So... we want to find a list of ______ for a given _______.
(Hint: representatives, address)

Navigate over to the API_lab.R file and let's begin.
